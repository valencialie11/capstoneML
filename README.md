This capstone is, by far, the most challenging task I had to do for Algoritma. Not because it is necessarily very hard, but it's because I had to juggle so many things at once. 
Not only do I have to complete this capstone well, I need to adapt to university life full of lectures and tutorials and also attend orientations for days. 
On top of that, I still have to move into my new hostel in the midst of everything. 

But, all in all, this capstone project has been extremely humbling and rewarding. I stumbled upon so many (SO SO SO MANY) problems and errors and even contemplated to choose a different project case more than 3 times!
This project has also taught me how important pre-processing data is because it can literally make or break your model. I once had MAE of over 45 (and I need it to be below 6) and had to spend hours and days to debug my codes and change my models' parameters, only to realise there is something wrong with how I process the data before modelling.

Regardless of it, I am extremely thankful for this opportunity with Algoritma for the past 4 months. I learnt so much about Data Science and Machine Learning, both the good and the bad, and I'm super excited to embark on a new 4 year journey with NTU!
